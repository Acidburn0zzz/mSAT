mSAT is an ocaml library provinding SAT/SMT/McSat solvers. More precisely,
what mSAT provides are functors to easily create such solvers. Indeed, the core
of a sat solver does not need much information about neither the exact representation
of terms nor the innner workings of a theory.

{4 Solver creation}

The following modules allow to easily create a SAT or SMT solver (remark: a SAT solver is
simply an SMT solver with an empty theory).

{!modules:
Solver
Formula_intf
Theory_intf
}

The following modules allow the creation of a McSat solver (Model Constructing solver):

{!á¹ƒodules:
Mcsolver
Expr_intf
Plugin_intf
}

Lastly, mSAT also provides an implementation of Tseitin's CNF conversion:

{!modules
Tseitin
Tseitin_intf
}

{4 Proof Management}

mSAT solvers are able to provide detailed proofs when an unsat state is reached. To do
so, it require the provided theory to give proofs of the tautologies it gives the solver.
These proofs will be called lemmas. The type of lemmas is defined by the theory and can
very well be [unit].

In this context a proof is a resolution tree, whose conclusion (i.e. root) is the
empty clause, effectively allowing to deduce [false] from the hypotheses.
A resolution tree is a binary tree whose nodes are clauses. Inner nodes' clauses are
obtained by performing resolution between the two clauses of the children nodes, while
leafs of the tree are either hypotheses, or tautologies (i.e. conflicts returned by
the theory).

Res_intf

Backends for exporting proofs to different formats:

{!modules:
Dot
Dedukti
Backend_intf
}

{4 Internal modules}

WARNING: for advanced users only ! These modules expose a lot of unsafe functions
that must be used with care to not break the required invariants. Additionally, these
interfaces are not part of the main API and so are subject to a lot more breaking changes
than the safe modules above.

{!modules:

Solver_types_intf
