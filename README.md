# MSAT

MSAT is an OCaml library that features a modular SAT-solver and some
extensions (including SMT). This is *work in progress*.


It derives from [Alt-Ergo Zero](http://cubicle.lri.fr/alt-ergo-zero).

The following theories should be supported:

- Equality and uninterpreted functions
- Arithmetic (linear, non-linear, integer, real)
- Enumerated data-types
